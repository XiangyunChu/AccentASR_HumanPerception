Detailed Info for Accent-Combined Corpus Creation in paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04627


## Three Sources Accented Corpora:

#### 1. Mozilla Common Voice corpus

The Common Voice corpus contains 1,400 hours of voice samples from 42,000 contributors across 18 languages. Users specify their accents across categories such as US, Australia, England, Canada, Philippines, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Scotland, Singapore, South Atlantic, African, Wales, and Bermuda. For this project, the data was subset to contain only the English language corpus, which has 39.5 hours of speech recordings in mp3 format. For accent study, the data were subset to exclude self-specified US accents.


#### 2. Singapore English National Speech corpus

From Part2 - Channel 0 of the corpus, we add all the speech data from 33 randomly sampled speakers to our Accent-Combined training set. Similarly, we add all the speech data from 4 randomly sampled speakers (different to the ones selected for training set) to our Accent-Combined development set.


#### 3. L2-Arctic corpus

The Arctic corpus includes recordings from 24 non-native speakers of English with balanced gender whose first language is either Hindi, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic or Vietnamese. The total duration of the corpus is 27.1 hours. On average, each speaker recorded approximately one hour of speech, reading the same CMUâ€™s ARCTIC prompts. The entire L2-Arctic training set is included in Accent-Combined training data. Similarly, the entire L2-Arctic development set is included in Accent-Combined development data.

## Table of Component:

| Attempt | Subsampled Train (Hour)| Subsampled Dev (Hour) | Train/Dev Ratio|
| -------------| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Mozilla Common Voice | 22.84h  | 4.29h  | 5:32: 1  |
| Singapore English National Speech | 24.24h  | 4.80h  | 5.05 : 1  |
| L2-Arctic | 22.84h  | 4.23h  | 5.40 : 1  |
| TOTAL | 69.92h  | 13.32h  | 5.25: 1  |
